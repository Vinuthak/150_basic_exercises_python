#A here document (or "heredoc") is a way of specifying a text block, preserving the line breaks, indents, and other whitespace within the text. The said code uses triple quotes to define a multi-line string, also known as a heredoc string. It allows the string to span multiple lines without the need to escape newline characters.

#The output will be the string exactly as it appears in the code, including the newline characters.
print("""
